# Lab: Teaching Pac-Man to Search

Overview
In this lab, I have taught the Pac-Man to search his world to complete the following tasks:

• find a single obstacle.<br>
• find multiple obstacles.<br>
• find the fastest way to eat all the food in the map.<br>

Using BFS, DFS, and A Star to teach Pac-Man to navigate his world in the most efficient way possible.
