# Artificial-Intelligence<br>
This repository contains my whole journey through Artificial Intelligence during my study.<br>

# Project 1

Sudoku Solver<br>
• An AI agent that solves the given sudoku in an efficient and quick way.<br>
• The project is implemented using a nice GUI.<br>
• Various stratergies that improve the speed of solution an reduce the expansion of state space have been implemented.<br>

# Project 2

Isolation Board Game Playing AI<br>
• An AI bot that plays the game of Isolation by itself.<br>
• The large state space in the game has been pruned using stratergies like - Alpha Beta Pruning etc.<br> 
• The agent is utilizing the Minimax algorithm with various custom Heuristics to reduce the Horizon effect.<br>

# Project 3

Pacman AI bot<br>
• An AI bot that plays the Pacman game all by itself. <br>
• It finds the path with the best score possible along with enemies/ghosts/food-pellets etc.<br>
• Various search strategies along with heuristics were implemented such as Adverserial, A* etc.<br>

# Project 4
Simulated Annealing

# Project 5
Uploading soon

# Project 6

Solving AIR CARGO PROBLEM via PDDL<br>
• A Planning Problem - given different planes and cargo destinations and airports , find the optimal path for the travelling and transportation of cargos.<br>
• Solved using a Planning Graph with PDDL.<br>
• The Planning Graph helps in finding very good heuristics and reduces the exponential size of state space search tree.<br>

# Project 7
• The project, describes a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.<br>
• Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.<br>
• Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, it focusses on important design decisions about the user experience for the app.<br>

# Project 8
• A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!<br>
• Used the LibriSpeech dataset to train and evaluate models.<br>
• The algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR.<br>
• Then moving on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text.<br> 
• Final implementation was a Bidirectional RNN's with no batch normalization and GRU/LSTM units in different layers and with Time Distributed Dense Layers.<br>
