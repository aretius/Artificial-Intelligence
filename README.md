# Artificial-Intelligence<br>
This repository contains my whole journey through Artificial Intelligence during my study.<br>

#Project 1

Sudoku Solver<br>
An AI agent that solves the given sudoku pretty efficiently and fast. The project has a nice GUI. The strategies that have been implemented are from www.sudokudragon.com . This is done to improve the speed of solution as much as possible.

#Project 2

Isolation Board Game Playing AI<br>
An AI bot that plays the game of Isolation by itself. The large state space needed to explore in such a game has been explored and strategies to shorten and reduce it such as alpha beta pruning have been used. The agent is built on the logic of minimax algorithm with various custom heuristics implemented and tested to improve further efficiency and reduce Horizon effect.

#Project 3

Pacman AI bot<br>
An AI bot that navigates the Pacman all by itself to find the shortest path with the maximum score and avoiding ghost while college all food pellets.
