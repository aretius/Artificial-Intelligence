# Artificial-Intelligence<br>
This repository contains my whole journey through Artificial Intelligence during my study.<br>

# Project 1

Sudoku Solver<br>
• An AI agent that solves the given sudoku in an efficient and quick way.<br>
• The project is implemented using a nice GUI.<br>
• Various stratergies that improve the speed of solution an reduce the expansion of state space have been implemented.<br>

# Project 2

Isolation Board Game Playing AI<br>
• An AI bot that plays the game of Isolation by itself.<br>
• The large state space in the game has been pruned using stratergies like - Alpha Beta Pruning etc.<br> 
• The agent is utilizing the Minimax algorithm with various custom Heuristics to reduce the Horizon effect.<br>

# Project 3

Pacman AI bot<br>
• An AI bot that plays the Pacman game all by itself. It finds the path with the best score possible which is increased by eating food pellets that are spread in various locations accross the map. There are Ghosts and powerups that can kill ghosts , so including these the AI bot solves the Pacman game by itself.
Various search strategies along with heuristics were implemented.

# Project 4
Simulated Annealing

# Project 5
Uploading soon

# Project 6

Solving AIR CARGO PROBLEM via PDDL
• A Planning Problem - given different planes and cargo destinations and airports , find the optimal path for the travelling and transportation of cargos.<br>
• Solved using a Planning Graph with PDDL.<br>
• The Planning Graph helps in finding very good heuristics and reduces the exponential size of state space search tree.<br>

# Project 7
• The project, describes a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.<br>
• Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.<br>
• Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, it focusses on important design decisions about the user experience for the app.<br>

# Project 8
• A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!<br>
• Used the LibriSpeech dataset to train and evaluate models.<br>
• The algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR.<br>
• Then moving on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text.<br> 
• Final implementation was a Bidirectional RNN's with no batch normalization and GRU/LSTM units in different layers and with Time Distributed Dense Layers.<br>
