# Artificial-Intelligence<br>
This repository contains my whole journey through Artificial Intelligence during my study.<br>

# Project 1

Sudoku Solver<br>
An AI agent that solves the given sudoku pretty efficiently and fast. The project has a nice GUI. The strategies that have been implemented are from www.sudokudragon.com . This is done to improve the speed of solution as much as possible. Just to mention few strategies -- 

# Project 2

Isolation Board Game Playing AI<br>
An AI bot that plays the game of Isolation by itself. The large state space needed to explore in such a game has been explored and strategies to shorten and reduce it such as alpha beta pruning have been used. The agent is built on the logic of minimax algorithm with various custom heuristics implemented and tested to improve further efficiency and reduce Horizon effect.

# Project 3

Pacman AI bot<br>
An AI bot that plays the Pacman game all by itself. It finds the path with the best score possible which is increased by eating food pellets that are spread in various locations accross the map. There are Ghosts and powerups that can kill ghosts , so including these the AI bot solves the Pacman game by itself.
Various search strategies along with heuristics were implemented.

# Project 6

Solving AIR CARGO PROBLEM via PDDL
This is a Planning Problem that is as follows , given different planes and cargo destinations and airports , find the optimal path for the travelling and transportation of cargos.
The problem is solved using a Planning Graph with PDDL. The Planning Graph helps in finding very good heuristics and reduces the exponential size of state space search tree.
