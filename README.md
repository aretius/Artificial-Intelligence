# Artificial-Intelligence<br>
This repository contains my whole journey through Artificial Intelligence during my study.<br>

# Project 1

Sudoku Solver<br>
An AI agent that solves the given sudoku pretty efficiently and fast. The project has a nice GUI. The strategies that have been implemented are from www.sudokudragon.com . This is done to improve the speed of solution as much as possible. Just to mention few strategies -- 

# Project 2

Isolation Board Game Playing AI<br>
An AI bot that plays the game of Isolation by itself. The large state space needed to explore in such a game has been explored and strategies to shorten and reduce it such as alpha beta pruning have been used. The agent is built on the logic of minimax algorithm with various custom heuristics implemented and tested to improve further efficiency and reduce Horizon effect.

# Project 3

Pacman AI bot<br>
An AI bot that plays the Pacman game all by itself. It finds the path with the best score possible which is increased by eating food pellets that are spread in various locations accross the map. There are Ghosts and powerups that can kill ghosts , so including these the AI bot solves the Pacman game by itself.
Various search strategies along with heuristics were implemented.

# Project 4
Simulated Annealing

# Project 5
Uploading soon

# Project 6

Solving AIR CARGO PROBLEM via PDDL
This is a Planning Problem that is as follows , given different planes and cargo destinations and airports , find the optimal path for the travelling and transportation of cargos.
The problem is solved using a Planning Graph with PDDL. The Planning Graph helps in finding very good heuristics and reduces the exponential size of state space search tree.

# Project 7
This project, describes a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, it focusses on important design decisions about the user experience for the app

# Project 8
A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

Used the LibriSpeech dataset that will be used to train and evaluate models. The algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. Then it moves on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, created and tested your own state-of-the-art models. 
Final implementation was a Bidirectional RNN's with no batch normalization and GRU/LSTM units in different layers and with Time Distributed Dense Layers.
